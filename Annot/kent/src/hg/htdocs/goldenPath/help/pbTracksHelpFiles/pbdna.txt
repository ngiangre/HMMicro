<!------------Description---------->
The display of this track varies, depending on which genomic strand the mRNA
aligns to. 
<P>
If the mRNA matches the forward (+) strand of the genomic sequence as 
displayed in the Genome Browser, the DNA sequence is displayed as a single row 
of nucleotides -- labeled &quot;Genomic Sequence&quot; -- whose codons are read 
directly into the amino acid sequence.
<P>
If the mRNA matches the reverse (-) strand of the genomic sequence,
the track shows both strands of the DNA.
The upper strand  -- labeled &quot;Coding Sequence&quot; -- matches the mRNA, 
to follow the convention that a 
protein sequence is displayed in the amino-to-carboxy direction.  The 
genomic sequence as displayed in the Genome Browser, therefore, is read from 
the lower strand (labeled &quot;Genomic Sequence&quot;) in the reverse direction.
<P>
For example, the first few codons of the gene for human thymidylate kinase, 
CDC8, appear on the negative strand of chromosome 2 in the hg16 Genome Browser
as:

The genomic sequence and complement displayed in this track are derived from 
the kgProtMap table (an alignment between protein, mRNA, and genome) and the 
base genome.
