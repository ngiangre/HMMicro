<!------------Description---------->
This track shows the 
distribution of hydrophobic residues across the selected protein, according to 
the Kyte-Doolittle scale. Using a sliding 6-amino-acid window, this scale
assigns positive values to hydrophobic amino acids, which are shown in blue above the center line on the 
track. Hydrophilic amino acids are displayed in red below the center line.
<P>
Hydrophobic residues occur most notably in the interior of 
globular proteins, as trans-membrane segments, in membrane-inserted tails, 
or as surface patches in domains that bind to other subunits of oligomers.
Hydrophilic amino acids are typically found on protein surfaces exposed to 
an aqueous environment.
<P>
See the <A HREF="pbhydro.shtml">Hydrophobicity histogram</A> to view the mean hydrophobicity 
of this protein relative to a genome-wide distribution.
