<!------------Description---------->
This histogram compares the selected protein's cysteine 
count to a genome-wide statistical distribution of cysteine abundance in 
human proteins, based on the cysteine abundance in all proteins found in the 
Known Genes data set for this genome assembly. The number of cysteines in
this protein is shown at the top of the graph, and its relative position in 
the genome is indicated by a dark blue vertical line overlying the genome-wide
distribution histogram.
<P>
To view the locations of cysteines along the peptide chain, see the 
<A HREF="pbcCntTr.shtml">Cysteines track</A>.
