<!------------Description---------->
This histogram shows the mean hydrophobicity for the selected protein relative
to a genome-wide distribution of all proteins in the UniProtKB database, which is 
essentially a broad Gaussian centered on zero. A few proteins fall outside
the plotting display range and are not accounted for in this distribution. The mean 
hydrophobicity is shown at the top of the histogram, and is indicated by a dark blue 
vertical line overlying the genome-wide distribution. 
<P>
To view the distribution of hydrophobic residues across the selected protein,
see the <A HREF="pbhydroTr.shtml">Hydrophobicity track</A>.
