<!------------Description---------->
This track shows the polarity of each amino acid in the protein
sequence. Amino acids tending toward negative charge are represented by red
blocks below the center line; amino acids tending to positive charge are
represented in blue above the line. The height of the block gives
some indication of relative polarity for un-ionized amino acids. For example,
serine is given a lower height than aspartic acid. 
<P>
The pI histogram in the Polarity discussion section 
shows the genome-wide statistical distribution of pI of human
proteins from UniProtKB and TrEMBL. For reasons of solubility, few
proteins have a pI near intra-cellular pH, resulting in a bimodal peak about
this pH.
<P>
See the <A HREF="pbpepPi.shtml">pI histogram</A> to view the pI of the selected protein 
relative to a genome-wide statistical distribution of pI of all proteins from 
UniProtKB and TrEMBL.
