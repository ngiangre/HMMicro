<!------------Description---------->
This histogram shows the selected protein's molecular weight relatve 
to a genome-wide statistical distribution of molecular weights of all proteins 
from UniProtKB. TrEMBL-NEW proteins are not included in the 
distribution. The molecular weight is shown at the top of the histogram, and
a vertical dark blue bar indicates the weight relative to the genome-wide
distribution.
<P>
The distribution data were generated by using the UniProtKB 
<A HREF="http://us.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html" TARGET=_blank>molecular
weight calculation tool</A> on the set of protein IDs.
