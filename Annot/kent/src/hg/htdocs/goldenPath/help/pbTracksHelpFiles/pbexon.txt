<!------------Description---------->
This track shows the position and layout of exons within the gene and their 
correspondence to the protein's amino acid sequence. Exons are
depicted by alternating blue and green bands, and are labeled by their order
number within the gene. This blue/green coloring is repeated in the DNA 
Sequence track, which also shows the coding phase. 
In cases where exon boundaries are stair-stepped, 
the amino acid coding has been split across two exons.

Click on an exon to display the corresponding region in the UCSC Genome
Browser. See the <A HREF="pbexonCnt.shtml">Number of Exons histogram</A> to view 
the exon count for this gene and compare it to a genome-wide 
statistical distribution. 
<P>
The exon positions displayed in this track were derived from the kgProtMap
table (an alignment of protein, mRNA, and genome data).
