<!------------Description---------->
This histogram displays a genome-wide statistical distribution 
based on the number of coding exons in the kgProtMap table. The number of
coding exons in the selected protein is displayed at the top of the graph, 
and a dark blue vertical line highlights this count relative to the 
genome-wide distribution. 
<P>
To view a linear depiction of the position and layout of the exons within the
gene and their correspondence to the protein's amino acid sequence, see the
<A HREF="pbexon.shtml">Exons track</A>.
<P>
The exon positions displayed in this track were derived from the kgProtMap
table (an alignment of protein, mRNA, and genome data).
