<!------------Description---------->
The pI (isoelectric point) histogram shows the pI of the selected protein relative 
to a genome-wide statistical distribution of pI of all proteins from UniProtKB. 
TrEMBL-NEW proteins are not included in the distribution. The
calculated pI of the protein is displayed at the top of the histogram, and is
shown as a vertical dark blue line overlying the statistical distribution. 
<P>
The distribution data were generated by using the UniProtKB 
<A HREF="http://us.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html" TARGET=_blank>pI
calculation tool</A> on the set of protein IDs. 
<P>
To view the polarity of each of the amino acids in the protein sequence, see the <A
