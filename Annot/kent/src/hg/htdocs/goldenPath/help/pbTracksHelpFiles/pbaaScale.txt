<!------------Description----------->
The top and bottom tracks provide a scale to determine the amino acid length of the 
selected protein. The label of the final tick mark on the scale shows the
protein's total amino acid count. 
<P>
NOTE: Some web browsers may not display the 
largest proteins correctly due to width limitations. In this case, use the
arrow controls to view the carboxy end of the protein.
